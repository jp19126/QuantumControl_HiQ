# Quantum Control series based on the HiQ platform
This repository features various kinds of quantum control problems. Most of the work contribute to LIU Baojie, PhD student in Professor Man-Hong Yung's group, Department of Physics, Southern University of Science and Technology. These codes aims to be run on the HiQ platform by Huawei.

1. Superadiabatic holonomic quantum computation in cavity QED[1]. The paper focused on implementing universal holonomic quantum computation based of non-Abelian geometric phases with superadiabatic quantum control, where the adiabatic manipulation is sped up while retaining its robustness against errors in the timing control.
